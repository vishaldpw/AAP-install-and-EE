Here are the steps for installing Ansible Automation in a better format:

**Step 1:** Register with Red Hat and obtain a 60-day free trial for the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). Download the tar.gz file.

**Step 2:** Create a Red Hat instance in AWS with the following specifications:
- Instance Type: m4.large
- Storage: 50GB
- Inbound Port Configurations: Allow inbound connections on ports 80 and 443 for TCP.

**Step 3:** Open your command prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory where the downloaded tar.gz file exists using the "cd" command, e.g., `cd Downloads`.

**Step 4:** Copy the .tar.gz file to your Red Hat instance, and then gunzip and untar the file. 
You can use commands like `scp` or any other method you prefer for copying.

**Step 5:** Make changes in your Ansible inventory file:
```
[automationcontroller]
hostname ansible_connection=local
```
Add the required "admin password" and "pg password" in the inventory file.
```
**Step 6:** Run the setup script:
```
./setup.sh
```

**Step 7:** Access Ansible Tower using a web browser by navigating to `https://<ip>` 
where `<ip>` is the IP address of your Red Hat instance. Use the credentials you set in the inventory file to log in.

**Step 8:** When opening Ansible Tower using the IP address, you will encounter a subscription management page. 
Provide your Red Hat Portal username and password.

**Step 9:** After providing your Red Hat credentials, the subscriptions will populate. 
Select the appropriate subscription and proceed by clicking "Next" as needed.

**Step 10:** You're done! Ansible Automation Platform is now installed and configured on your Red Hat instance, and you can begin using it for automation tasks.

Please note that the actual commands and paths may vary depending on your specific setup and environment. 
Ensure you have appropriate permissions and access rights for the installation and configuration steps.
